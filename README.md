# Abstractive Summarizer for Youtube videos using Speech-to-Text and Transformer-Model

## About the Project
The amount of digital consumption in teh form of Audio and Video has become so prominant than ever before. Due to which we have so much of content that is available for our limited amount of time. Just like an abstract for a research paper, it would be easier if we have a quick summary of the video, which can help us understand what the video actually trying to convey. In this project I tried to solve this problem using the recent developements in deeplearning sphere STT (Speect-to-text) and TTT (Text-to-Text) transformer models.
